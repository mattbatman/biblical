  When David was living in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I live in a cedar house, but the ark of Yahweh’s covenant is in a tent.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V2">

  </span>
  “Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;

  for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V6">
    6
  </span>
  In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’ ” ’
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V7">
    7

  “Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V8">
    8
  </span>
  I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V9">
    9
  </span>
  I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first,
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V10">
    10
  </span>
  and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V11">
    11
  </span>
  It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

  Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

    21

  What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people whom you redeemed out of Egypt?
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V22">
    22
  </span>
  For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V23">
    23
  </span>
  Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V24">
    24
  </span>
  Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V25">
    25
  </span>
  For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V26">
    26
  </span>
  Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH17V27">

  David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.”

  Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”
</div>
<div class="p">

  Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V5">
    5

  Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V6">

  God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.

  “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.” ’ ”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V11">
    11

  So Gad came to David and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:

    12
  </span>
  either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’ ”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V13">
    13

  David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand, for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V14">

  So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V15">
    15
  </span>
  God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V16">
    16
  </span>
  David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.

<div class="p">
  Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V17">

  David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done?

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V18">

  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V19">
    19

  David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name.

  Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V21">

  As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V22">

  Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V23">

  Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V24">

  King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="1CH21V25">

  David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.

<div class="p">

  At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

  David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who served the king by division, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.

  Then David the king stood up on his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH28V3">

  But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’
  <span class="verse" id="1CH28V4">

  However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
  <span class="verse" id="1CH28V5">

  He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
