  They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?

</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI1V10">
    10

  Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI1V11">
    11

  <span class="verse" id="2KI1V13">

  Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty of your servants be precious in your sight.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI1V14">
    14
  </span>
  Behold, fire came down from the sky and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”

  Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.”

  Then he arose and went down with him to the king.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI1V16">

  He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’ ”

  So he died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.

  </span>
  When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V2">
    2
  </span>
  Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V3">
    3
  </span>
  The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from over you today?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V4">
    4
  </span>
  Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V5">
    5
  </span>
  The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from over you today?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V6">
    6
  </span>
  Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V7">
    7
  </span>
  Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V8">
    8
  </span>
  Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters; and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V9">
    9
  </span>
  When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V10">
    10
  </span>
  He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V11">
    11
  </span>
  As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V12">
    12
  </span>
  Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V13">
    13
  </span>
  He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V14">
    14
  </span>
  He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V15">
    15
  </span>
  When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V16">
    16
  </span>
  They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain or into some valley.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He said, “Don’t send them.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V17">
    17
  </span>
  When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V18">
    18
  </span>
  They came back to him while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go’?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V19">
    19
  </span>
  The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V20">
    20
  </span>
  He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V21">
    21
  </span>
  He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’ ”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V22">
    22
  </span>
  So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V23">
    23
  </span>
  He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V24">
    24
  </span>
  He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of those youths.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI2V25">
    25
  </span>
  He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.

  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V1">

  </span>
  Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V2">
    2
  </span>
  He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, but not like his father and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V3">
    3
  </span>
  Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V4">
    4
  </span>
  Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V5">
    5
  </span>
  But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V6">
    6
  </span>
  King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V7">
    7
  </span>
  He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V8">
    8
  </span>
  Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Jehoram answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V9">
    9
  </span>
  So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V10">
    10
  </span>
  The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V11">
    11
  </span>
  But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yahweh here, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V12">
    12
  </span>
  Jehoshaphat said, “Yahweh’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V13">
    13
  </span>
  Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  The king of Israel said to him, “No, for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V14">
    14
  </span>
  Elisha said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V15">
    15
  </span>
  But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, Yahweh’s hand came on him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V16">
    16
  </span>
  He said, “Yahweh says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V17">
    17
  </span>
  For Yahweh says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V18">
    18
  </span>
  This is an easy thing in Yahweh’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V19">
    19
  </span>
  You shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’ ”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V20">
    20
  </span>
  In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V21">
    21
  </span>
  Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V22">
    22
  </span>
  They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V23">
    23
  </span>
  They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V24">
    24
  </span>
  When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V25">
    25
  </span>
  They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it and attacked it.

  When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI3V27">

  Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

  Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V2">

  Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?”

  She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”

  Go in and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour oil into all those containers; and set aside those which are full.”

<div class="p">

  So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil.

  When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”

  He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V7">

  Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”

  One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V9">
    9
  </span>
  She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V10">

  </span>
  Please, let’s make a little room on the roof. Let’s set a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand for him there. When he comes to us, he can stay there.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V11">

  One day he came there, and he went to the room and lay there.

  He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.

  He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’ ”

<div class="p">
  She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V14">
    14

  He said, “What then is to be done for her?”

</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V15">

  He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door.

  He said, “At this season next year, you will embrace a son.”

  She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V17">
    17

  The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V18">

  </span>
  When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V19">
    19

  He said to his father, “My head! My head!”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V20">

  When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V21">
    21
  </span>
  She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, and shut the door on him, and went out.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V22">
    22
  </span>
  She called to her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come again.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V23">
    23

  He said, “Why would you want to go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.”

  She said, “It’s all right.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V24">
    24

  Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V25">
    25

  So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V26">
    26
  </span>
  Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?’ ”

  She answered, “It is well.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V27">
    27

  When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V28">
    28
  </span>
  Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V29">
    29
  </span>
  Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child’s face.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V30">
    30
  </span>
  The child’s mother said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.”

<div class="p">
  So he arose, and followed her.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V31">
    31

  Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child’s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V32">

  When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V33">

  He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V34">
    34
  </span>
  He went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V35">
    35
  </span>
  Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth, then went up and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V36">
    36
  </span>
  He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her.

<div class="p">
  When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V37">

  Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V39">
    39
  </span>
  One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognize them.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V40">
    40
  </span>
  So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V41">
    41
  </span>
  But he said, “Then bring meal.” He threw it into the pot; and he said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V42">
    42
  </span>
  A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI4V43">
    43

  His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?”

  But he said, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’ ”

  Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria; he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V2">

  The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little girl, and she waited on Naaman’s wife.

  </span>
  She said to her mistress, “I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V4">

  Someone went in and told his lord, saying, “The girl who is from the land of Israel said this.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V5">
    5
  </span>
  The king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”

<div class="p">
  He departed, and took with him ten talents

  of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V6">
    6

  He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V7">
    7
  </span>
  When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V8">
    8
  </span>
  It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V9">
    9

  So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V10">
    10
  </span>
  Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V11">
    11
  </span>
  But Naaman was angry, and went away and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.’
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V12">
    12
  </span>
  Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V13">
    13
  </span>
  His servants came near and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V14">
    14
  </span>
  Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V15">
    15
  </span>
  He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V16">
    16

  But he said, “As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He urged him to take it; but he refused.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V17">
    17

  Naaman said, “If not, then, please let two mules’ load of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.

    18

  In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V19">

  He said to him, “Go in peace.”

  So he departed from him a little way.

    20
  </span>
  But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V21">
    21

  So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V22">
    22

  He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V23">
    23

  Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI5V24">
    24
  </span>
  When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.

  But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?”

  The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once or twice.

  So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;
  <span class="verse" id="2KI9V15">
    15
  </span>
  but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI9V16">
    16

  So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.

  Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.”

  Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’ ”

  So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, “the king says, ‘Is it peace?’ ”

  They got his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him on Naboth the Jezreelite’s land.

  When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”

</div>
<div class="p">

  Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI9V25">
    25
  </span>
  Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:
  <span class="verse" id="2KI9V26">
    26

  ‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,’ says Yahweh; ‘and I will repay you in this plot of ground,’ says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to Yahweh’s word.”

  But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI9V28">

  His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in David’s city.

</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V4">

  But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand before him! How then shall we stand?”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V5">
    5
  </span>
  He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V6">
    6
  </span>
  Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men who are your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V7">
    7
  </span>
  When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and killed them, even seventy people, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V8">
    8
  </span>
  A messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V9">
    9
  </span>
  In the morning, he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?

    10
  </span>

  So Jehu struck all that remained of Ahab’s house in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.

  He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V13">
    13
  </span>
  Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?”
</div>

  They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”

    14

  He said, “Take them alive!”

</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V15">
    15
  </span>
  When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Jehonadab answered, “It is.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  “If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V16">
    16

  He said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.” So they made him ride in his chariot.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V17">
    17

  When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed them, according to Yahweh’s word which he spoke to Elijah.

  Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V19">
    19
  </span>
  Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshipers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent, for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did deceptively, intending to destroy the worshipers of Baal.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V20">
    20
  </span>
  Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!”
</div>
<div class="p">
  So they proclaimed it.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V21">
    21
  </span>
  Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V22">
    22
  </span>
  He said to him who kept the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal!”
</div>
<div class="p">
  So he brought robes out to them.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V23">
    23
  </span>
  Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and see that none of the servants of Yahweh are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V24">
    24
  </span>
  So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V25">
    25
  </span>
  As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them! Let no one escape.” So they struck them with the edge of the sword. The guard and the captains threw the bodies out, and went to the inner shrine of the house of Baal.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V26">
    26
  </span>
  They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal and burned them.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V27">
    27
  </span>
  They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V28">
    28

  Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V29">
    29
  </span>
  However, Jehu didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin—the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V30">
    30
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to Ahab’s house according to all that was in my heart, your descendants shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V31">
    31

  But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI10V32">

  In those days Yahweh began to cut away parts of Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel

  Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.

  Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do that which was right in Yahweh his God’s eyes, like David his father.

  <span class="verse" id="2KI16V6">
    6

  So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI16V8">

  Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI16V9">

  King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a drawing of the altar and plans to build it.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI16V11">
    11

  Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus.

  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V2">
    2
  </span>
  He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V3">
    3
  </span>
  Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V4">
    4
  </span>
  The king of Assyria discovered a conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria seized him, and bound him in prison.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V5">
    5
  </span>
  Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V6">
    6
  </span>
  In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V7">
    7
  </span>
  It was so because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V8">
    8
  </span>
  and walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V9">
    9
  </span>
  The children of Israel secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God; and they built high places for themselves in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V10">
    10
  </span>
  and they set up for themselves pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree;
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V11">
    11
  </span>
  and there they burned incense in all the high places, as the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them did; and they did wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V12">
    12
  </span>
  and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V13">
    13
  </span>
  Yet Yahweh testified to Israel and to Judah, by every prophet and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V14">
    14
  </span>
  Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck like the neck of their fathers who didn’t believe in Yahweh their God.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V15">
    15
  </span>
  They rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V16">
    16
  </span>
  They abandoned all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made molten images for themselves, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V17">
    17
  </span>
  They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V18">
    18
  </span>
  Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V19">
    19
  </span>
  Also Judah didn’t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V20">
    20
  </span>
  Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of raiders, until he had cast them out of his sight.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V21">
    21
  </span>
  For he tore Israel from David’s house; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V22">
    22
  </span>
  The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t depart from them
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V23">
    23
  </span>
  until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he said by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V24">
    24
  </span>
  The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, from Cuthah, from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V25">
    25
  </span>
  So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V26">
    26
  </span>
  Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria don’t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them; and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V27">
    27
  </span>
  Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let him

</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V28">
    28

  So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V29">
    29
  </span>
  However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V30">
    30
  </span>
  The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V31">
    31
  </span>
  and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V32">
    32
  </span>
  So they feared Yahweh, and also made from among themselves priests of the high places for themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V33">
    33
  </span>
  They feared Yahweh, and also served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V34">
    34
  </span>
  To this day they do what they did before. They don’t fear Yahweh, and they do not follow the statutes, or the ordinances, or the law, or the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V35">
    35
  </span>
  with whom Yahweh had made a covenant and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V36">
    36
  </span>
  but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall sacrifice to him.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V37">
    37
  </span>
  The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V38">
    38

  You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods.
  <span class="verse" id="2KI17V39">

  However they didn’t listen, but they did what they did before.

  ‘Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.’ ” ’ ” So they brought this message back to the king.
