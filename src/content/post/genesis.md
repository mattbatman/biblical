### Chapter 1

#### Synopsis
Story of God creating everything in six days.

#### Points of Interest
Genesis 1:6-8 suggests that there is water below us and above us. It seems to describe God creating a tunnel between waters.

Genesis 1:14 suggests that night and day weren't made until the fourth day, yet somehow "evening" and "morning" had been passing for the previous three days. What, then, is morning and evening?

Genesis 1:24 differentiates between livestock, wild animals, and creatures that move along the ground.

Genesis 1:26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."

Who is the "us" that God would refer to?

Genesis 1:29 God gave every seed-bearing plant as food for all creatures with life. I was expecting God to also give all creates to men and woman as food.
