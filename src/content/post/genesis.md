## Points of Interest

* [Genesis 1:6-8](#GEN1V6) seems to suggest that there is water below us and above us. It seems to describe God creating a tunnel between waters.
* [Genesis 1:14](#GEN1V14) suggests that night and day weren't made until the fourth day, yet somehow "evening" and "morning" had been passing for the previous three days. What, then, is morning and evening?
* [Genesis 1:26](#GEN1V26) Who is the "us" that God would refer to?
* [Genesis 1:29](#GEN1V29) God gave every seed-bearing plant as food for all creatures with life. I was expecting God to also give all creatures to men and woman as food.
* [Genesis 2:2](#GEN2V2) Why does God need to rest? What does he do to relax?
* [Genesis 2:5](#GEN2V5) It seems weird that God created vegetation on the third day, but this verse states (in the NIV version) that "no shrub of the field had yet appeared on earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth..."
* [Genesis 2:7](#GEN2V7) Man was made from a combination of dust and "breath of life"
* [Genesis 2:9](#GEN2V9) The tree of Life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were two separate trees.
* [Genesis 2:10-2:14](#GEN2V10) Can these rivers be identified today to reveal the location of the location of the Garden of Eden?
* [Genesis 2:22](#GEN2V22) A woman was made from the rib of man while he was in a deep sleep, like it was a surgical operation.
* [Genesis 2:25](#GEN2V25) Famous nudity and shame verse.

<span class="verse" id="GEN2V1">1&#160;</span>The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V2">2&#160;</span>On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V3">3&#160;</span>God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.

There was not a man to till the ground,  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V6">6&#160;</span>but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V7">7&#160;</span>Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V8">8&#160;</span>Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V9">9&#160;</span>Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V10">10&#160;</span>A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V11">11&#160;</span>The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V12">12&#160;</span>and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium<a href="#GEN2FN2" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> or, aromatic resin</span></a> and onyx stone are also there.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V13">13&#160;</span>The name of the second river is Gihon.

This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V15">15&#160;</span>Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V17">17&#160;</span>but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="GEN2V18">18&#160;</span>Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone.

As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V22">22&#160;</span>Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.  <span class="verse" id="GEN2V23">23&#160;</span>The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.
