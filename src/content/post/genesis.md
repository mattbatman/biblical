## Points of Interest

* [Genesis 1:6-8](#GEN1V6) seems to suggest that there is water below us and above us. It seems to describe God creating a tunnel between waters. I believe some people site this as "the firmament."
* [Genesis 1:14](#GEN1V14) suggests that night and day weren't made until the fourth day, yet somehow "evening" and "morning" had been passing for the previous three days. What, then, is morning and evening?
* [Genesis 1:26](#GEN1V26) Who is the "us" that God would refer to?
* [Genesis 1:29](#GEN1V29) God gave every seed-bearing plant as food for all creatures with life. I was expecting God to also give all creatures to men and woman as food, as well.
* [Genesis 2:2](#GEN2V2) Why does God need to rest? What does he do to relax?
* [Genesis 2:5](#GEN2V5) It seems weird that God created vegetation on the third day, but this verse states (in the NIV version) that "no shrub of the field had yet appeared on earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth..."
* [Genesis 2:7](#GEN2V7) Man was made from a combination of dust and "breath of life."
* [Genesis 2:9](#GEN2V9) The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were two separate trees.
* [Genesis 2:16-17](#GEN2V16) This is "the lie."
* [Genesis 2:10-2:14](#GEN2V10) Can these rivers be identified today to reveal the location of the location of the Garden of Eden?
* [Genesis 2:19](#GEN2V19) Man got to name every living creature.
* [Genesis 2:22](#GEN2V22) A woman was made from the rib of man while he was in a deep sleep, like it was a surgical operation.
* [Genesis 2:25](#GEN2V25) Famous nudity and shame verse.
* [Genesis 3:4](#GEN3V4) I guess this suggests that knowledge of good and evil is innate.
* [Genesis 3:6](#GEN3V6) It's not clear that Adam knew what he was eating.
* [Genesis 3:7](#GEN3V7) The first thing they felt guilt for was being naked. 
* [Genesis 3:8](#GEN3V8) God was just walking around, talking.
* [Genesis 3:12](#GEN3V12) Adam does not take responsibility. 
* [Genesis 3:13](#GEN3V13) The woman says the serpent deceived her, but it seems like he just convinced her.
* [Genesis 3:14](#GEN3V14) Did the serpent have legs before this? 
* [Genesis 3:15](#GEN3V15) Are serpents and humans destined to be the worst of enemies? 
* [Genesis 3:16](#GEN3V16) Women were curses with painful child birth and to be ruled over by their husband.
* [Genesis 3:17-19](#GEN3V17) Man's curse just seems to be to have to work more, to farm.
* [Genesis 3:22](#GEN3V22) Who's the "us" that God refers to? Why shouldn't man live forever?
* [Genesis 3:24](#GEN3V24) When were "cherubim" created? 
* [Genesis 4:2-5](#GEN4V2) Cain and Abel were able to just walk up to God to give him offerings. God preferred fat to fruit.
* [Genesis 4:6-7](#GEN4V6) It seems like God thinks Cain should know that jealousy or envy is a sin. The Bible doesn't mention, yet, what exactly constitutes sin, or what training any of the humans have yet had.
* [Genesis 4:9](#GEN4V9) Similar to when God called out Adam, he first asked him a question, and let Cain respond. This is the brother's keeper verse.
* [Genesis 4:14](#GEN4V14) Who are the people that may find Cain?
* [Genesis 4:15](#GEN4V15) Mark of Cain.
* [Genesis 4:17](#GEN4V17) Who was to be Cain's wife that was not his sister? What concept did Cain have of a city?
* [Genesis 5:21-24](#GEN5V21) It seems Enoch lived 365 years and then was taken somewhere by God.
* [Genesis 5:25](#GEN5V25) Methuselah is often cited as the longest living person at 969 years.
* [Genesis 6:1-6:4](#GEN6V1) God's sons mated with women. Who, or what, were God's sons?
* [Genesis 6:4](#GEN6V4) Nephilim.
* [Genesis 7:2](#GEN7V2) This is the numbers of animals for Noah's Ark. I think just remember two of every animal from this story as a kid. Was is a clean animal?
* [Genesis 9:1-4](#GEN9V1) It seems like people were supposed to be vegetarians before the flood, but were permitted to eat animals after the flood.
* [Genesis 9:6](#GEN9V6) It seems a curse was placed, that any man who kills another will be killed.
* [Genesis 9:12-17](#GEN9V12) God created rainbows as a reminder to himself not to kill every living creature on the Earth via flood again.
* [Genesis 9:20-28](#GEN9V20) Where is Noah's sense of personal accountability? How was this the only redeeming man at the time of the flood? It seems drastic to curse the lineage of your own son because you got drunk and passed out naked.
* [Genesis 11:1-9](#GEN11V1) I remembered the Tower of Babel as being about the sinful pride of a ruler, but it just kind of seems like God was concerned that men working together would be able to achieve too much. It also seems strange that God is using plural language again ("let's go down...").
* [Genesis 12:12-20](#GEN12V12) No comment is made on whether Abram's lie is a sin.

  The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V2">
    2
  </span>
  and he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V3">

  </span>
  He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V4">
    4
  </span>
  But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V5">
    5
  </span>
  They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V6">
    6

  Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V7">
    7
  </span>
  He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V8">

  See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V9">
    9

  They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V10">
    10
  </span>
  But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V11">

  They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V13">
    13
  </span>
  for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V14">
    14

  Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city!”

<div class="p">
  But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V15">

  When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V16">
    16
  </span>
  But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V17">
    17
  </span>
  It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V18">

  Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.

    19
  </span>
  See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V20">

  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V22">
    22

  Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

  Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.

  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V30">

  Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.

  They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V34">
    34
  </span>
  It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN19V35">

  He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.

    20
  </span>
  You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’ ” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”

  Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”

    14

  She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife.

  When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.

  He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.

  He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.

  Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN38V21">
    21

  Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?”

  Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”

  When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”

  Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V2">
    2
  </span>
  Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V3">

  His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V4">

  Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V5">
    5
  </span>
  From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V6">
    6
  </span>
  He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.

<div class="p">
  Joseph was well-built and handsome.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V7">
    7

  After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V8">
    8
  </span>
  But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V9">
    9
  </span>
  No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V10">
    10

  As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V11">
    11

  About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V12">
    12

  She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!”

  He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.

  When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V14">
    14

  she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V15">
    15
  </span>
  When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V16">
    16
  </span>
  She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V17">
    17
  </span>
  She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V18">
    18
  </span>
  and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V19">
    19
  </span>
  When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V20">
    20
  </span>
  Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V21">
    21
  </span>
  But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V22">
    22
  </span>
  The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN39V23">

  The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.

  After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.

  Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker.

  He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

  The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V5">
    5
  </span>
  They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V6">
    6
  </span>
  Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V7">
    7
  </span>
  He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V8">
    8
  </span>
  They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.”

<div class="p">
  Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V9">
    9
  </span>
  The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V10">
    10
  </span>
  and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V11">
    11
  </span>
  Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V12">
    12
  </span>
  Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V13">
    13
  </span>
  Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V14">
    14
  </span>
  But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V15">
    15

  For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V16">
    16
  </span>
  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V17">
    17
  </span>
  In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”

  Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.

  Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V20">
    20
  </span>
  On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN40V21">
    21

  He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;

  At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V2">
    2

  Behold, seven cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.

  Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V4">
    4
  </span>
  The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V5">
    5
  </span>
  He slept and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V6">
    6
  </span>
  Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V7">
    7
  </span>
  The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V8">
    8
  </span>
  In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V9">
    9
  </span>
  Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V10">
    10
  </span>
  Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, with the chief baker.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V11">
    11
  </span>
  We dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each man dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V12">
    12
  </span>
  There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V13">
    13

  As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V14">
    14

  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V15">
    15

  Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”

  The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle;

    21

  and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V22">
    22
  </span>
  I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good;
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V23">

  </span>
  and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V24">
    24
  </span>
  The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V25">
    25

  Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.

  The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V27">
    27
  </span>
  The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V28">
    28
  </span>
  That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V29">
    29
  </span>
  Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V30">
    30

  Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V31">
    31
  </span>
  and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V32">
    32
  </span>
  The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

<div class="p">

  “Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.

  Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V35">
    35
  </span>
  Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V36">
    36
  </span>
  The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V37">

  The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

  Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”

  Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”

  Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN41V43">
    43

  In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.

<div class="p">
  He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V10">
    10
  </span>
  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V11">
    11
  </span>
  Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V12">

  Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V13">
    13
  </span>
  Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V14">
    14
  </span>
  Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V15">
    15
  </span>
  He blessed Joseph, and said,
</div>
<div class="q">
  “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,

  the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,

<div class="q">
  and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.

<div class="q">
  Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V17">
    17
  </span>
  When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V18">
    18
  </span>
  Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V19">
    19
  </span>
  His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V20">
    20
  </span>
  He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’ ” He set Ephraim before Manasseh.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V21">
    21
  </span>
  Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
  <span class="verse" id="GEN48V22">
    22
  </span>
  Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”
