The Book of Job

### 1

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V1">
    1
  </span>
  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,
  <a href="#JOB1FN1" class="notemark">
    †
    <span class="popup">
      The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
    </span>
  </a>
  and turned away from evil.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V2">
    2
  </span>
  There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V3">
    3
  </span>
  His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V4">
    4
  </span>
  His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V5">
    5
  </span>
  It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V6">
    6
  </span>
  Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,
  <a href="#JOB1FN2" class="notemark">
    ‡
    <span class="popup">
      “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
    </span>
  </a>
  Satan also came among them.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V7">
    7
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V8">
    8
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V9">
    9
  </span>
  Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V10">
    10
  </span>
  Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V11">
    11
  </span>
  But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V12">
    12
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold,
  <a href="#JOB1FN3" class="notemark">
    §
    <span class="popup">
      “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
    </span>
  </a>
  all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V13">
    13
  </span>
  It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V14">
    14
  </span>
  that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V15">
    15
  </span>
  and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V16">
    16
  </span>
  While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V17">
    17
  </span>
  While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V18">
    18
  </span>
  While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V19">
    19
  </span>
  and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V20">
    20
  </span>
  Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V21">
    21
  </span>
  He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.”
  <span class="verse" id="JOB1V22">
    22
  </span>
  In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V1">

  </span>
  Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V2">
    2
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V3">
    3
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V4">
    4
  </span>
  Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V5">
    5
  </span>
  But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V6">
    6
  </span>
  Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V7">
    7
  </span>
  So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V8">
    8
  </span>
  He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V9">
    9
  </span>
  Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V10">
    10
  </span>
  But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”
</div>
<div class="p">
  In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V11">
    11
  </span>
  Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V12">
    12
  </span>
  When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB2V13">
    13
  </span>
  So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.

  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V3">

<div class="q2">

<div class="q2">
  things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.
</div>
<div class="q">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V4">

<div class="q2">
  I will question you, and you will answer me.’
</div>
<div class="q">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V5">

  It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V8">
    8
  </span>
  Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”
</div>
<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V9">

  So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V10">
    10

  Yahweh restored Job’s prosperity when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.

  Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,
  <a href="#JOB42FN1" class="notemark">

<div class="p">
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V12">
    12

  So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V13">
    13
  </span>
  He had also seven sons and three daughters.
  <span class="verse" id="JOB42V14">
    14

  He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.

  In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
